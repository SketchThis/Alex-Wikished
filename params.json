{"name":"Wikished","tagline":"This is a Wikished, a fork of the Wikihouse project","body":"So after the great time I had building a Wikihouse with the guys at Sketchup last year at Maker Faire, I’ve decided that I want to build one of my own… to live in.\r\nUsing Wikihouse’s open library of components, I have begun work on designing my own house. I’ve started documenting all of my work here:\r\n\r\nI’ve also been reaching out to local colleges to see if their architecture programs would be interested in participating in some way.\r\n\r\nWhile I work on that design, I want to experiment with different types of plywood. OSB seems to be readily available, cheap, and easy to work with.\r\n\r\nBefore I go and cut an entire house out of plywood, I’ve decided to build something simpler: A shed.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SketchThis/Alex-Wikished/master/VIZ_0035.png)\r\n\r\nHere in this GIT repository you'll find the files you'll need to cut this out. At this moment the files are NOT done, but good enought to get a quote. What's left is to finish adding clearances so that the parts fit right in the field.\r\n\r\nTO READ MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT CHECK OUT THE BLOG:\r\n\r\nhttp://sketchthis.net/tag/wikihouse-project/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
