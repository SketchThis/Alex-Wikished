          <p>So after the great time I had building a Wikihouse with the guys at Sketchup last year at Maker Faire, I’ve decided that I want to build one of my own… to live in.
Using Wikihouse’s open library of components, I have begun work on designing my own house. I’ve started documenting all of my work here:</p>

<p>I’ve also been reaching out to local colleges to see if their architecture programs would be interested in participating in some way.</p>

<p>While I work on that design, I want to experiment with different types of plywood. OSB seems to be readily available, cheap, and easy to work with.</p>

<p>Before I go and cut an entire house out of plywood, I’ve decided to build something simpler: A shed.</p>

<p>Here in this GIT repository you'll find the files you'll need to cut this out. At this moment the files are NOT done, but good enought to get a quote. What's left is to finish adding clearances so that the parts fit right in the field.</p>
